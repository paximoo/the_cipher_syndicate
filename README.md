# the_cipher_syndicate

Hello Hello! This is the official project of 'the_cipher_syndicate' for the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025 (at Techno NJR, Udaipur)

"Removing the 'Whether' from your 'Weather'."

Our Project, WeatherWise analyses the daily historical weather data of nearly the past 35 years (including visualizations) from the free and open dataset at NASA POWER API to logically predict what might be the weather conditions on a selected future date at a given location.

We have built an interface that is accessible to the novice and a powerful tool for the seasoned.
There's a plain text output view that displays data in a table and a graphical heat-map to analyze daily-recorded data deeply which the user can swiftly switch between depending on their use case and knowledge with the subject.
There is also an option to download the raw data used in analysis as a CSV file.
The algorithm works on 8 different parameters, which are averaged to arrive at a final prediction for the required date.
